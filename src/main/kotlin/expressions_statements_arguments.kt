//expressions have value
//statements do not have value

//eg of expression: 3+6 because it has a value of 9
//also 4.7 * 11.8 is an expression

// eg of statement: val greeting = "hey there" because statements can also be assignments

fun main() {
    val runnable = 4.7 * 11.8
    println(runnable)
}
